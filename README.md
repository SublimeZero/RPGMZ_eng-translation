# RPG Maker MZ Unofficial JavaScript Reference

Games created with the casual game development environment "RPG Maker MZ" developed by Gotcha Gotcha Games run on JavaScript.

This is an unofficial reference for the JavaScript that powers those games. I, "Tonbi@[Tobi Island Workshop](http://tonbi.jp/)", have created and shared this personally.

Please use it as a reference when using the [Script] command during game development or as a companion for creating game extension plugins.<br />
When explaining JavaScript for "RPG Maker MZ", feel free to link to individual pages from various social media or blogs.

By the way, plugins are also published at the [RPG Tsukūru MZ Plugin Repository](https://github.com/tonbijp/RPGMakerMZ/).<br />
There is also an [RPGMV-CoreScript-Reference](https://katai5plate.github.io/RPGMV-CoreScript-Reference/) (the MV version of the reference).

## How to Use the Reference

**[Class Tree](index.md)** contains a list of classes (objects), so please search for your desired items there.<br />
It may be more convenient to bookmark the [Class Tree](index.md) page from this page.

Alternatively, you can enter a word in the search box at the top left of the page and search with [In this repository].<br />
Search is possible on any page, not just this one.

Just read it, and I hope you understand! (laugh)
